          Infected with a God-like power and stalked by undead hordes, a child
          is destined to defeat an otherworldly evil – yet malevolent forces aim
          to harness her power and unleash an ancient menace from its hellish
          bonds.

        Elena is elated to be on the cusp of a festival marking her journey into
        womanhood, but that happiness is tainted by a powerful secret she
        keeps…a secret that is bound to a timeless and dark prophesy. Charles,
        the half-human son of vampire Cosmin the Wicked, reels from centuries of
        damnation. Condemned to live forever, he is determined to destroy his
        father and lift the curse that afflicts his soul.
        <br />
        <br />
        Together, the unlikely pair must fight to right an ancient wrong and
        protect humanity from a primeval horror, one that is older than
        civilization itself and hungers to conquer Earth. Can they triumph over
        an ancient evil and save millions of lives...or will The Devil’s Cohort
        be unleashed?

          Get The Devil’s Cohort and immerse yourself in the timeless struggle
          of good versus evil with a modern and riveting twist.
